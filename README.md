In this project, I explored a dataset on Algerian forest fires to predict the Fire Weather Index (FWI) using various regression techniques. The dataset was cleaned and preprocessed to ensure quality data for modeling. I employed standardization, feature selection, and evaluated multiple regression models to achieve accurate predictions of FWI.

**Exploratory Data Analysis:**

Initially, I conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of forest fire classes and seasonal trends. Notably, August and September emerged as peak months for forest fires in both Sidi-Bel and Brjaia regions, reflecting critical periods for fire risk assessment.

**Data Preprocessing:**

To prepare the data for modeling, I performed:
- Data cleaning to handle missing values and format inconsistencies.
- Encoding of categorical variables, such as converting "not fire" and "fire" classes into binary representations (0 and 1).
- Feature selection based on correlation analysis to mitigate multicollinearity and enhance model interpretability.

**Modeling Approach:**

I implemented several regression techniques and evaluated their performance:

1. **Linear Regression:**
   - Achieved a high R² score of 0.984, indicating a strong linear relationship between predictors and FWI. However, it showed sensitivity to outliers and potential overfitting.

2. **Lasso Regression:**
   - Utilized Lasso regression to penalize less significant features, resulting in an improved mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.619 and R² score of 0.982. Lasso effectively reduced model complexity by shrinking coefficients towards zero.

3. **Ridge Regression:**
   - Implemented Ridge regression to address multicollinearity and stabilize the model. It yielded a similar performance to Lasso with an MAE of 0.564 and R² score of 0.984. Ridge regression's regularization parameter (alpha) was optimized using cross-validation.

4. **ElasticNet Regression:**
   - Combined L1 and L2 penalties using ElasticNet to leverage advantages of both Lasso and Ridge. Despite its higher MAE (0.657), it provided a respectable R² score of 0.981, offering robustness against multicollinearity.

**Conclusion:**

The adoption of Ridge, Lasso, and ElasticNet regression methods significantly enhanced predictive accuracy and model robustness compared to traditional linear regression. These techniques effectively managed overfitting, handled multicollinearity, and provided interpretable models suitable for predicting FWI based on Algerian forest fire data.

**Skills Demonstrated:**

- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** Ensuring data quality and preparing features for modeling.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Identifying seasonal patterns and critical factors influencing forest fires.
- **Regression Modeling:** Applying Ridge, Lasso, and ElasticNet to improve prediction accuracy and model reliability.
- **Evaluation and Optimization:** Using metrics such as MAE and R² to assess model performance and optimize hyperparameters.

By leveraging these techniques, I not only achieved higher accuracy in predicting FWI but also demonstrated proficiency in advanced regression methods critical for data-driven decision-making in environmental sciences and risk management.
